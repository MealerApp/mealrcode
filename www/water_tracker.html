      // Then we'll use the objectID field on the badges in order to save to the user record which badges you have won.
      
      // So, see https://www.parse.com/docs/js/symbols/Parse.Object.html and look at the addUnique method. You'll want to 
      // add the objectId for the Water Badge to the badges field on the user record.  
      
      // On parse.com data browser, I made it so that 'dude' already has the water badge to show you how it should look 
      // when you have it right.
      
      // Once you get that right, head on over to profile.html and work on showing the badges a user has actually earned.
